Session Details
===============

### Session Title

Isomorphic Hybrid Mobile Dev with Loopback.io

### Session Abstract

After this talk you will know all there is to know about developping an hybrid application.     
I will show you how easily you can build an **Instagram** like application.  

We will start with the awesome backend Loopback.io (built on top of express) with no more than 5 lines of code.   
Then you will see how you can generate isomorphic code on the client side as angular services, as we develop a simple but powerful mobile app that adds geolocation address on pictures as you upload them to the backend.   
Last, we will deploy the backend to *Heroku* and the mobile app to *TestFairy* so we can invite beta testers and see how they use it.
