About The Speaker
=================

### Name

Elior Boukhobza

### Biography

I am an experienced web developer with a background in software development, and am now specializing in writing full-stack
 web applications in Javascript. Insofar I have been developing applications in many different languages and frameworks: Java, PHP, .Net, 
 then Backbone.JS, to finally settle down with AngularJS and Node.JS in the server.

I am currently working in a company named CodeOasis as a senior web developer, providing development services and sometimes consulting; but
what I like the most is the ability to share my knowledge through lectures, meetups and sometimes by contributing to the open source 
community.
