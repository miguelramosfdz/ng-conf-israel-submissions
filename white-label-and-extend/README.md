Session Details

### Session Title

How to white label and extend an AngularJS application.

### Session Abstract

Working in a product company, you wake up one day and your manager asks you to install your app on one of your clients' servers but the client wants to see his logo instead of yours. Then you realize that the flow needs to be a bit different because the client wants to use his own authentication layer and wants to integrate his system. If you ever encountered a similar situation, this lecture is just for you. In this lecture I'll go over some of the practices that you can use in order to white label your app or inherit it and extend your logic using some real world examples.
