Session Details
===============

### Session Title

Data Services in AngularJS

### Session Abstract

There are many ways to load & handle data in AngularJS, derived from different requirements and different approaches.

I've seen about each and every one of them.

In this talk, we will cover how to implement different approaches, the pros & cons of each one, and how to determine which one is best for you.

We will also cover some existing open source libraries made for AngularJS, but more interestingly - what exists outside of AngularJS, such as JS-Data and Ember-Data.

I will also explain why (IMO) there's still no de-facto library that rules-them-all.

### Session Meta Data

- Target Audience: AngularJS Developers
- Length: Full session (45 minutes)
- Tags: Best Practices, OOP, Code methodology, Inheritance, Reusable, ES6
