### Session Title

 * Observables and data flows in Angular 2.0

## Session Abstract

In this talk we'll explore Observables through their data flows in the proposed Angular 2.0 HTTP API. We'll discuss the power of
using observables and how you can integrate them in your project today and be ready for Angular 2.0. We'll cover how data flows
in Angular 2.0, what observables are conceptually, the available options and how ES7 and Angular 2.0 will make complex data
flows easy and fun.

### Session Meta Data

 * Target Audience: Intermediate to Advanced, Developers.
 * Length: 15-30 minutes
 * Tags: Angular, Reactive, RxJS, BaconJS, ES7
 
 Some other meta data - I can make this talk short or long but I won't have time for anything longer than 30 minutes because I'm
 giving a talk on [YGLF](http://yougottalovefrontend.com/#speakers) and I likely won't have time to prepare anything longer. I'd
 love to introduce developers to more advanced concepts in reactive programming in Angular.
